# Privacy Policy for Internal QuickBooks Data Tool

**Last Updated:** May 8, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Matthew Dumas ("Developer," "we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the internal tool known as the Internal QuickBooks Data Tool (the "Tool"). This Policy applies to Matthew Dumas as the sole user ("User," "you," "your") of the Tool.

**1. Information We Handle**

* **QuickBooks Data:** The Tool is designed to access, process, or transmit data from your (the User's) QuickBooks account, as initiated and authorized by you. This data pertains to the User's Company and is accessed for the sole purpose of the Tool's functionality.
* **No Separate Data Collection by Developer:** As the Developer and the User are the same individual (Matthew Dumas) for this internal Tool, the Developer does not collect personal information from the User through the Tool for separate purposes. The Tool facilitates your access to your own data. Any data processing occurs under your control and direction.
* **Usage Data (If Applicable):** If the Tool incorporates any logging for debugging or performance monitoring purposes initiated by you, this data would be considered for internal use only by you, the User/Developer.

**2. How We Use Information**

* **To Provide Tool Functionality:** The primary use of any accessed QuickBooks data is to enable the features and functions of the Tool as intended by you, for managing the User's Company's financial information.
* **Internal Purposes:** As the Developer and User, any insights or data derived are for your own internal business analysis and operational use for the User's Company.

**3. Information Sharing and Disclosure**

* **No Third-Party Sharing:** Given that you are the sole Developer and User, and the Tool is for internal use with your own company data, information accessed by the Tool is not shared with any external third parties by the Developer. You, as the User, control access to your QuickBooks data.

**4. Data Security**

* **User Responsibility:** You are responsible for maintaining the security of your QuickBooks credentials, the security of the device(s) where the Tool is used, and any data extracted or stored by you through the Tool.
* **Tool Security:** The Developer (Matthew Dumas) commits to building and maintaining the Tool with reasonable security practices in mind. However, the ultimate security of the data relies on your management of your credentials and systems.

**5. Data Retention**

* The Tool itself does not retain your QuickBooks data beyond what is necessary for its immediate operation, unless you, as the User, configure it to store data locally under your control. Data retention policies are governed by your own practices and QuickBooks' terms.

**6. Your Rights and Choices**

* As you are both the Developer and the User, and the data is your company's data from QuickBooks, you have direct control over the data. Your rights regarding your QuickBooks data are primarily governed by your agreement with Intuit QuickBooks.
* You can choose to stop using the Tool at any time.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

* We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy. As the sole user, you will be inherently aware of any changes you implement.

**8. Contact Us**

* If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact:

**How to Use This Combined Document:**

1.  **Review Both Sections:** Ensure both the EULA and Privacy Policy accurately reflect the Tool's nature and your use.
2.  **Company Name:** Confirm if "the User's Company" is appropriate or if you want to insert a specific company name throughout.
3.  **Governing Law:** The EULA uses "State of California." Ensure this is appropriate for both.
4.  **Data Handling Details (Section 3 of EULA & Section 1, 4 of Privacy Policy):** While generalized, ensure these sections align with how the Tool actually works (e.g., if it *only* processes locally and never transmits data elsewhere, you might want to state that more explicitly).
5.  **Hosting:** Host this entire text (EULA and Privacy Policy) on a single publicly accessible URL (e.g., using GitHub Gist) to provide when required.

This combined document should now cover both legal aspects for your internal tool.

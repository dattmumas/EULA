**How to Use This:**

1.  **Review Generic Terms:** I've replaced `[Your Internal Tool Name]` with "Internal QuickBooks Data Tool" and `[Your Company Name]` with "the User's Company". You can change these if you have more specific names.
2.  **Data Handling (Section 3):** I've generalized the optional data handling description. You should still consider if you want to add a more specific sentence here about how your tool actually processes or stores data.
3.  **Governing Law (Section 8):** I've set this to "State of California" based on general information. If your business operates under a different jurisdiction, please update this.
4.  **Final Review:** Read through the entire document to ensure it accurately reflects your situation and intentions.
5.  **Integration:** When QuickBooks (or any platform) asks for a URL for your EULA, you can host this text on a simple webpage (like a public page on a Notion, a GitHub Gist, a simple static website, or even a shared document if the platform allows it and it's accessible via a URL).

This version should be more ready to use, but a final review by you for your specific context is always recommended.
